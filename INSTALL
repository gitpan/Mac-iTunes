This is the Mac::iTunes distribution, which contains both Mac specific
and OS neutral components. The Mac-specific portions interface with
the iTunes application through Applescript. The neutral portions deal
with the file and preference formats, which you may want to use on a 
computer that can read the files on a Mac (or in some other fashion).

If you are on a Mac and do not want the AppleScript portions, probably
because they are still pretty rough, you can set the environment variable
NO_MAC

	env NO_MAC=1 perl Makefile.PL
	
If you are not on a Mac, you get the same effect automatically.

Otherwise, it's the standard Perl module installation stuff.
