This is the Mac::iTunes distribution, which contains both Mac specific
and OS neutral components.  The Mac-specific portions interface with
the iTunes application through Applescript.  The neutral portions deal
with the file and preference formats, which you may want to use on a 
computer that can read the files on a Mac (or in some other fashion).

If you are on a Mac and do not want the AppleScript portions, probably
because they are still pretty rough, you can set the environment variable
NO_MAC

	env NO_MAC=1 perl Makefile.PL
	
If you are not on a Mac, you get the same effect automatically.

You can install this anywhere that you like.  If you want to install it
in a directory other than the main perl library, you can use the PREFIX
switch.

Install everything (lib, man) in my home directory, you can use one of
the following

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~
	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=$HOME
	
If you want to install it somewhere else, you only need to specify that
directory

	perl Makefile.PL
