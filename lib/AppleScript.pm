=item play

Start playing the current selection

=item pause

Pause playback.

=item playpause

Toggle the play-pause button.  If it's on play, it will pause, and
if it's on pause, it will play.

=item next, next_track

Skip to the next track

=item previous, previous_track

Skip to the previous track

=item redo, back_track

Go back to the start of the current track

=item stop

Stop playback.

=item fast_forward

Fast forward through the current selection.

=item rewind

Rewind through the current selection.

=item resume

Start playing after fast forward or rewind

=item quit

Quit iTunes

Open an item from the given URL

=item add_track( FILE, PLAYLIST_NAME )

Add the unix style path FILE to the user playlist with
name PLAYLIST_NAME.  Relative paths are resolved according
to the current working directory.

	add_track( 'mp3/song.mp3', 'Favorites' )

This function will create the playlist if it does not exist.

This function does not check if the track already exists in
the playlist.  If it does, you end up with duplicates.

BROKEN!

Returns true if the file is already in the iTunes library.

The library actually stores aliases to the real files, so
I can't simply check the file names---very frustrating.

one.
